My primary focus on this project was on the playable weapons. I designed three weapons that encourage different playstyles while maintaining similar power levels. As a technical game designer, my responsibilities included creating design documents, coding the weapon mechanics, collaborating with art and animation teams, implementing attack animations, and tweaking weapon parameters such as attack speeds and damage amounts based on playtest data.

The Axe is a strong and reliable weapon with decent distance and attacks that deal damage over a wide area. It's unique trait is that by holding and then releasing the light attack button you can perform a follow-up attack.

The Daggers are the fastest weapon in the game, allowing you to weave in and out of enemies' reach while slicing them to pieces. The daggers are the only weapon that has a string of light attacks. By pressing the light attack button again within a lenient amount of time, you can perform up to two follow-up attacks.

The Gauntlets are a powerful weapon allowing you to shoot energy from your fists. It is a hybrid melee/ranged weapon for players who want to fight from afar. Holding light attack allows you to aim your attack in any direction and the heavy attack can be used to push enemies back.
