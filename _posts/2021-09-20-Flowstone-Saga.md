<b> Monster Powers</b>
<img src="/assets/FlowstoneSagaGifs/LightningStrike.gif">
Monster powers are special attacks that enemies use during a battle, usually with a moderate cooldown. Tile removers are one type of monster power, that disrupts the player by removing tiles from the board and dealing damage based on the number of tiles removed. In this example a lightning bolt strikes down and removes tiles vertically in a zig-zag pattern.
