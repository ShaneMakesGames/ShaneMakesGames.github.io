<b> Custom Editor Tools</b><br>
<img src="/assets/BrawloweenGifs/NormalAttackCustomEditor.gif"><br>
One of my responsibilities on the project is to create tools to facilitate our content development. Shown above, is our custom editor tool for creating and editing Normal Attacks and Special Moves. The primary goal of this tool is to be modular, breaking the data into smaller groups. If I just want to edit a Normal Attack's Hitstun then I can just open the "Opponent Frame Data" group and leave all the other groups closed. Additionally, there is a toggle that opens all groups if you want to quickly take a look at the overall move. The editor also hides certain parameters based on context. For example, if a Special Move is not a Launcher, then the Launcher Force and Fall Speed parameters will be hidden because they will not be needed.<br><br>

I am also working on designing character movesets for the game. To learn about Clive, the Lycanthrope Boxer check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1USMjjvOdRkfbaPvTS6eGCgtBI-I_NxuO56K2gFUEH2Q/edit?usp=sharing"> Pitch Deck</a>. This presentation details both of the character's two styles including their movement abilities and special moves.
